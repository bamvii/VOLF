    The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford
    Coppola, who co-wrote the screenplay with Mario Puzo, based on Puzo's
    best-selling 1969 novel of the same name. The film stars Marlon Brando,
    Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden,
    John Marley, Richard Conte, and Diane Keaton. It is the first installment
    in The Godfather trilogy. The story, spanning from 1945 to 1955,
    chronicles the Corleone family under patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando),
    focusing on the transformation of his youngest son, Michael Corleone
    (Pacino), from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss.
